###    g. What is the main branch?
The main branch is the default development branch. Depending on the Git settings, old convention was called master but we are moving away from this naming convention

###    h. Besides our initial commit if it is a new repository, should we directly push our changes directly into the main branch?
It's best practice to make changes in a separate branch and use pull requests to merge them into main branch. this allows codes to be reviewed/discussed before approving before merging into main branch. reduces risk and allows increment changes
